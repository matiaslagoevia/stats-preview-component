## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM

### What I learned

**HTML Structure & BEM**

I used `@gracesnow`'s tutorial as a reference to help me overcome some hurdles I had.
I then used FigJam (I'd used Excalidraw before) to do some of the thinking and come up with the class names.

**Image skills: `<picture>`, `mix-blend-mode`, `object-fit`**

Grace's tutorial was helpful here as well, and I complemented it with MDN.

### Continued development
I'd like to continue to expand my understanding of BEM & effective HTML structure.
Also, I'd like to continue to get better with images and other types of media.
